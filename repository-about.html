<h2>Repository for Global South and Indigenous Arts Publications</h2>
<h3>About</h3>
	<p>This repository is intended to serve as a resource for readers, activists, and creatives interested in exploring experimental artistic approaches to sovereignty for the Global South and First Peoples. By bringing together publications from different geographies and traditions under this umbrella, it hopes to cultivate solidarity between anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist struggles around the world.</p>
	<p>My hope is that those who use this resource can spend some time really engaging with epistemologies, stories, pedagogical practices, and liberational struggles beyond their own. The aim of this is not to inspire ephiphanies about the universality of the human condition nor to facilitate the conceit of cosmopolitan sophistication––as critics of the genre of "world literature" in the West have rightly observed––but rather to encourage us to collaborate at the bounds of intelligiblity, with a respect for differences. After all, it is capitalism's ability to subsume whatever it touches into its logic that has gradually molded land, culture, and bodies into secular commodities with no other attribute than the ability to be consumed.</p>
	<p>Note on terminology: "Indigenous," "Aborigine," "First Nations," and "First Peoples" are used with relative interchangeability to refer loosely to populations displaced from and subjugated in their traditional lands at the hands of institutional, particularly settler-colonial, entities. In cases where specificity is needed, such as in Canadian contexts where "First Nations" has a particular definition, an effort is made to distinguish between a general and specific usage of the term, especially in cases when the term may transcend geopolitical borders.</p>
	<p>The repository is in its early stages. Please reach out to me for suggestions!</p>
